## Overview

**Comprehensive story enhancement workflow with quality gates.**

This workflow implements a complete dev-QA collaboration cycle:
1. **Dev Phase**: Implement enhancements + unit tests
2. **QA Phase**: Review, define gates, validate
3. **Fix Phase**: Dev addresses QA feedback
4. **Documentation Phase**: Update story/epic status and docs
5. **Final Report**: Comprehensive summary

**Perfect for:**
- Enhancing partially implemented stories
- Adding missing features with quality assurance
- Stories requiring both dev work and QA validation
- Ensuring production-ready quality

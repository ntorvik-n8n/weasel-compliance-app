name: Silent Autonomous Resolution
version: 2.0
icon: ü§ñüîá
description: Zero-input workflow that autonomously detects, diagnoses, fixes, and validates all project issues silently - specialized for Weasel (Collections Call Monitor) Azure deployment
whenToUse: When you want complete autonomous project health maintenance with zero interaction, especially for fixing Azure deployment issues and simplifying storage architecture
requiredAgents: [dev, qa]
estimatedTime: 15-120 minutes (variable based on findings)
autonomyLevel: maximum
userInputRequired: none
reportingMode: completion-only
projectContext: Weasel Compliance Monitor (Next.js 15 + Anthropic + Azure)
```

## Overview

**The ultimate autonomous workflow - combining intelligence with silence.**

This workflow merges the best of `auto-resolve` (autonomous problem detection) and `silent-execute` (zero-interruption execution):

- üîç **Auto-detects** all project issues, blockers, and failing tests
- üîá **Operates silently** - no status updates, no confirmations
- ü§ñ **Fixes everything** autonomously using best judgment
- ‚úÖ **Validates thoroughly** before reporting
- üìä **Reports once** - comprehensive summary when done

**Perfect for:**
- **Fixing Azure deployment AI inferencing issues** (local works, cloud fails)
- **Simplifying storage architecture** (removing date partitioning)
- Daily project health maintenance
- Overnight autonomous cleanup
- Pre-deployment health checks
- Post-merge issue resolution
- "Fix everything" scenarios
- When you trust the agent completely

---

## How It Works

### Initiation
```
User: *workflow silent-auto-resolve

Agent: ü§ñüîá Silent auto-resolve activated. Analyzing project...
       Will report when complete or blocked.

[Agent works autonomously for 15-120 minutes]

Agent: ‚úÖ Silent auto-resolve complete.

       [Comprehensive report with all fixes]
```

### During Execution
- **Complete silence** - No updates unless critically blocked
- **Autonomous decisions** - Makes all choices independently
- **Comprehensive scope** - Fixes everything found, not just one issue
- **Smart prioritization** - Handles critical blockers first
- **Continuous validation** - Tests after each fix
- **Rollback safety** - Reverts if validation fails

### User Can (Optionally) Check Progress
While workflow runs silently:
- `*plan-status` - View current progress without interrupting
- `*exit` - Gracefully stop and get current state report
- Otherwise, do other work and wait for completion

---

## Autonomous Detection & Resolution Scope

### What the Workflow Autonomously Detects:

#### üî¥ **Critical Issues** (Fixed First)
- **Azure deployment AI inferencing failures** (Anthropic API not working in Static Web App/Container)
- **Azure Blob Storage architecture issues** (date-partitioned vs flat structure)
- **Local vs Cloud environment parity** (different backend storage accounts)
- Build failures
- Type errors preventing compilation
- Runtime errors in recent commits
- Failed tests blocking progress
- Missing critical environment variables
- Broken API endpoints
- File upload/storage failures
- Database connection issues

#### üü° **Quality Issues** (Fixed Second)
- Linting errors and warnings
- Code formatting inconsistencies
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete type definitions
- Unused imports and variables
- Console.log statements in production code
- TODO comments with actionable items

#### üü¢ **Maintenance Tasks** (Fixed Third)
- Outdated documentation
- Missing unit tests for new features
- Code duplication opportunities
- Performance optimization candidates
- Security vulnerabilities (dependency updates)
- Accessibility issues
- Missing or incomplete comments

### What Gets Fixed Automatically:

‚úÖ **Code Issues**
- Type errors and interface mismatches
- Import path corrections
- Missing dependencies installation
- Syntax errors
- Async/await issues
- Error handling gaps

‚úÖ **Tests**
- Failing unit tests
- Broken integration tests
- Missing test coverage for new code
- Outdated test snapshots
- Mock data issues

‚úÖ **Configuration**
- Invalid environment variables (using safe defaults)
- Misconfigured API routes
- Broken build configurations
- Incorrect TypeScript settings

‚úÖ **Documentation**
- Outdated README sections
- Missing API documentation
- Incorrect code examples
- Stale status documents

‚úÖ **Code Quality**
- ESLint violations
- Prettier formatting
- Unused code removal
- Import organization
- Type assertion improvements

---

## Autonomous Decision Framework

### Auto-Approve (No user input):
‚úÖ All code fixes (syntax, types, logic)
‚úÖ Test creation and updates
‚úÖ Documentation updates
‚úÖ Dependency installation (npm/yarn)
‚úÖ Linting and formatting
‚úÖ Git commits with clear messages (triggers auto-deployment to Azure)
‚úÖ File creation/modification
‚úÖ Configuration fixes (non-security)
‚úÖ Performance optimizations
‚úÖ Error handling improvements
‚úÖ Refactoring for code quality
‚úÖ Azure resource verification (read-only checks)

### Auto-Deploy Behavior:
‚ö° **Important:** When commits are pushed to the repository, Azure Static Web Apps automatically deploys changes
‚ö° The workflow will commit fixes, which triggers Azure CI/CD pipeline
‚ö° Validation includes testing in deployed Azure environment after auto-deployment completes
‚ö° Both Static Web App and Container App deployments are monitored

### Stop and Report (Requires user):
üõë Missing critical secrets (API keys not in environment)
üõë Database schema migrations
üõë Breaking API changes requiring user decision
üõë Manual production deployments (auto-deployment via git is OK)
üõë Cost-incurring operations beyond normal usage
üõë Destructive data operations
üõë Security system modifications
üõë When multiple valid approaches exist with significant trade-offs

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 0: Safety Preparation (Auto)
**Duration:** 1 minute

**Actions:**
1. **Create Safety Branch:**
   - Check current git branch (`git branch --show-current`)
   - Create new feature branch with timestamp: `git checkout -b workflow/silent-auto-resolve-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
   - **Purpose:** Preserves the current codebase state for easy rollback
   - **Rollback:** If issues occur, simply `git checkout <original-branch>` to return to pre-workflow state
   - **Branch naming:** `workflow/silent-auto-resolve-20251014-143027` (example)

2. **Verify Clean State:**
   - Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - If uncommitted changes exist, stash them: `git stash save "Pre-workflow stash at $(date)"`
   - Document stash hash for potential recovery

3. **Safety Notes:**
   - Original branch remains untouched until workflow completes successfully
   - All commits happen on the new feature branch
   - User can merge or discard feature branch after reviewing results
   - Auto-deployment to Azure will occur from feature branch (user can revert if needed)

**Output:** New feature branch created, clean working directory, original state preserved

---

### Phase 1: Silent Project Analysis (Auto)
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

**Actions:**
1. **Read project context:**
   - STATUS_RESUME.md or equivalent for current blockers
   - CLAUDE.md for project architecture and requirements
   - docs/prd.md for product requirements understanding

2. **Analyze deployment environment:**
   - Check Azure Static Web App status: https://salmon-hill-0ca04f60f.2.azurestaticapps.net
   - Check Azure Container App status: https://billcollector-hill-gvbybeach-985d7362.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io/
   - Compare local vs cloud behavior
   - Identify AI inferencing failures in Azure

3. **Inspect storage architecture:**
   - Review current blob storage structure (date-partitioned)
   - Identify complexity in raw/processed/backups containers
   - Assess impact of simplifying to flat structure

4. **Standard health checks:**
   - Run git status to check uncommitted changes
   - Analyze recent commits for patterns
   - Review error logs and debug files
   - Check build status (npm run build)
   - Run test suite to identify failures
   - Scan for linting errors (npm run lint)
   - Check TypeScript compilation
   - Verify API routes functionality
   - Assess documentation currency

**Output:** Internal priority matrix (not shown to user)

---

### Phase 2: Silent Issue Prioritization (Auto)
**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

**Actions:**
1. Categorize issues by severity (Critical ‚Üí Quality ‚Üí Maintenance)
2. Identify dependencies between fixes
3. Create execution plan optimizing for:
   - Unblocking critical functionality first
   - Minimizing rework (fix root causes before symptoms)
   - Maximizing test coverage
4. Initialize TodoWrite tracking (visible with `*plan-status`)

**Output:** Internal execution plan

---

### Phase 3: Silent Autonomous Execution (Auto)
**Duration:** 10-90 minutes (varies by issues found)

**Actions:**

1. **Fix Weasel-Specific Critical Issues:**

   a. **Azure AI Inferencing Fix:**
   - Diagnose why Anthropic API works locally but fails in Azure deployments
   - Check environment variable propagation to Azure (Static Web App and Container App)
   - Verify API key format and accessibility in serverless functions
   - Test API calls in Azure context vs local context
   - Fix any Azure-specific CORS, timeout, or networking issues
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging in production
   - Validate fix works in both deployment targets

   b. **Storage Architecture Simplification:**
   - Refactor blob storage from date-partitioned (`YYYY/MM/DD/`) to flat structure
   - Update from separate containers (`call-logs-raw`, `call-logs-processed`, `call-logs-backups`) to simplified `raw` and `processed`
   - Modify `lib/azure-storage.ts` to remove date segmentation logic
   - Update API routes: `/api/upload`, `/api/process`, `/api/files/[filename]`
   - Ensure local and cloud environments use same storage account (DELETE's appears to be working)
   - No data migration needed (all files are in `sample-files/` directory)
   - Update metadata handling to work with flat structure
   - Simplify filename collision logic without date partitioning

   c. **Environment Parity:**
   - Ensure `.env.local` configuration matches Azure App Settings
   - Verify both local and cloud use same `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
   - Test that storage operations behave identically in both environments

2. **Fix Standard Critical Issues:**
   - Address build failures
   - Fix type errors
   - Resolve runtime errors
   - Fix failing tests
   - Unblock API routes

3. **Improve Code Quality:**
   - Fix linting errors
   - Apply consistent formatting
   - Add missing error handling
   - Complete type definitions
   - Remove unused code

4. **Enhance Maintainability:**
   - Update documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, architecture docs)
   - Add missing unit tests for refactored storage code
   - Improve code comments
   - Refactor duplicated code
   - Update dependencies (if safe)

5. **After Each Fix:**
   - Run relevant tests (unit and integration)
   - Test locally with `npm run dev`
   - Verify no regressions
   - Update TodoWrite progress
   - Commit with descriptive message following git conventions
   - Log action to debug log
   - Auto-deploy to Azure via git push triggers

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Retry failures once
   - Rollback if validation fails
   - Skip non-critical failures
   - Document unresolved issues requiring user intervention

---

### Phase 4: Silent Comprehensive Validation (Auto)
**Duration:** 5-15 minutes

**Actions:**

1. **Weasel-Specific Validation:**
   - **Test Azure AI Inferencing:**
     - Upload sample file from `sample-files/standard-call.json`
     - Verify upload progresses through all stages (uploaded ‚Üí processing ‚Üí analyzed)
     - Confirm metadata changes from "uploaded" to final analysis state
     - Validate AI analysis completes successfully in Azure (not just locally)
     - Check analysis results appear correctly in processed container

   - **Test Storage Architecture:**
     - Upload test file and verify it lands in flat `raw` container (not date-partitioned)
     - Verify processing moves file to flat `processed` container
     - Test file listing API returns correct files without date logic
     - Confirm filename collision handling works with new flat structure
     - Verify DELETE operations work (already confirmed working)

   - **Test Environment Parity:**
     - Run same test locally (`npm run dev`)
     - Run same test in Azure Static Web App (https://salmon-hill-0ca04f60f.2.azurestaticapps.net)
     - Compare results - should be identical
     - Verify both use same backend storage account

2. **Create/Update Unit Tests:**
   - Unit tests for refactored `lib/azure-storage.ts` (flat structure)
   - Unit tests for updated API routes
   - Unit tests for filename collision handling (without dates)
   - Integration tests for end-to-end upload ‚Üí process ‚Üí analyze flow
   - Mock tests for Anthropic API calls

3. **QA Validation Gate:**
   - Run complete test suite (unit + integration)
   - Verify build succeeds (`npm run build`)
   - Check linting passes (`npm run lint`)
   - Validate TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`)
   - Test critical user flows:
     - File upload via drag-and-drop
     - File processing and AI analysis
     - File listing and viewing
     - File deletion
   - Review git diff for unintended changes
   - Verify documentation accuracy (CLAUDE.md, README.md)
   - Confirm STATUS_RESUME.md reflects current state

**Output:** Validation results (reported in final summary)

---

### Phase 5: Completion Report (Report)
**Duration:** 1 minute

**Generate comprehensive summary:**
- Issues found and resolved
- Files modified with change descriptions
- Test results (before ‚Üí after)

## Tips for Maximum Success

1. **Workflow creates safety branch automatically** - Original branch preserved, easy rollback
2. **Keep tests updated** - Workflow validates using your test suite
3. **Maintain STATUS_RESUME.md** - Provides critical context
4. **Trust the process** - Avoid checking status constantly
5. **Review commits afterward** - Understand what changed and learn (`git diff main`)
6. **Test before merging** - Workflow completes on feature branch, you control merge to main
7. **Run periodically** - Daily or after merges for best results
8. **Ensure .env.local is configured** - Prevents blocks on missing secrets
9. **Keep dependencies current** - Reduces complex upgrade issues
10. **Easy rollback** - Just `git checkout main` to undo everything

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Workflow completed but missed something important?**
A: Run again with `--focus=<area>` to target specific issues, or use `auto-resolve` for more control.

**Q: Too many changes at once?**
A: Use `silent-execute` for specific tasks, or `auto-resolve` to review plans before execution.

**Q: Workflow seems to be taking too long?**
A: Check `*plan-status` - may be fixing many issues. Large cleanups can take 60-90 minutes.

**Q: Want to stop mid-workflow?**
A: Use `*exit` to gracefully stop and receive progress report with completed work.

**Q: Workflow made unexpected changes?**
A: Review commits with `git log` and `git diff`. Revert specific commits if needed. Provide feedback to improve future runs.

**Q: How often should I run this?**
A: Daily is ideal, or after merges/major changes. Prevents issue accumulation.

## Integration Example

### Morning Routine
```bash
# Start your day with automated project health check
*workflow silent-auto-resolve

# While that runs, get coffee and check email
# 20-30 minutes later, return to clean, tested, documented codebase

# Review what was fixed
git log --oneline -10

# Continue development with confidence
*agent dev
```

### Pre-Commit Hook
```bash
# Before committing major changes
*workflow silent-auto-resolve --quick

# Ensures your branch is clean before push
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Include in CI pipeline
*workflow silent-auto-resolve --skip-integration --max-time=15m

# Catches issues before they reach production
```

## Philosophy

This workflow embodies the principle: **"Maximize autonomy, minimize interruption, maximize quality."**

It treats your codebase as a living system requiring regular maintenance, applying:
- **Preventive care** (catching issues early)
- **Corrective action** (fixing problems found)
- **Continuous improvement** (enhancing quality over time)

All while respecting your time by working silently and reporting comprehensively.

**Trust the agent. Do other work. Return to a healthier codebase.**

# QA Gate Assessment for Story 2.4
# Epic 2: Call Log Management System

story_id: 2.4
story_name: Status Indicators and Processing States
qa_agent: Quinn (Test Architect)
assessment_date: 2025-10-11
status: PASSED

summary: >
  All previously identified gaps have been successfully addressed. The application
  now features a visually informative `StatusBadge` component and a real-time
  polling mechanism to keep file statuses up-to-date automatically.

findings:
  - id: 2.4-F1
    type: Critical Functional Gap
    severity: High
    description: >
      The `StatusBadge` component was not created, and the UI lacked detailed,
      visually distinct status indicators.
    status: FIXED

  - id: 2.4-F2
    type: Critical Functional Gap
    severity: High
    description: >
      The real-time status update mechanism (polling hook and API endpoint) was
      completely missing.
    status: FIXED

  - id: 2.4-F3
    type: Integration Gap
    severity: Medium
    description: >
      The polling hook was created but not integrated into the main application,
      meaning no real-time updates were occurring.
    status: FIXED

overall_recommendation: >
  The story should be moved back to "In Progress." It requires full implementation
  of all components as designed, from the backend API to the frontend UI and
  state management, to meet its acceptance criteria.

status: PASSED

summary: >
  The developer has successfully created a secure and reusable client for the
  Anthropic API. The implementation correctly uses environment variables for
  API key management and provides a wrapper function that returns a strongly-typed,
  structured JSON object as required. Validation was performed by creating an
  in-app test page that successfully executed an end-to-end API call.

findings:
  - id: 3.1-F1
    type: Test Environment Issue
    severity: Low
    description: >
      Initial attempts to validate the story using a standalone `ts-node` script
      failed due to complexities with TypeScript path mapping and module resolution
      in the test environment.
    resolution: >
      Switched to an integrated testing approach by creating a temporary Next.js
      page and API route (`/test/analysis`), which provided a stable environment
      to validate the feature. The underlying implementation was correct.

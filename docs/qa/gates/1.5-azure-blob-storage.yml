comments: |
  Excellent implementation of Azure Blob Storage integration with production-ready enhancements.

  The retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter is exemplary - this demonstrates deep
  understanding of distributed systems and cloud resilience patterns. The 16 comprehensive
  tests provide confidence in reliability.

  The Azure Setup Guide is outstanding - clear, comprehensive, and covers both novice and
  advanced scenarios. The troubleshooting section and cost estimates show attention to
  real-world deployment needs.

  Core Azure Blob Storage implementation was already complete from previous stories, which
  speaks to the quality of the overall project architecture. This story successfully added
  the production enhancements needed for reliable operation.

  Minor note: Monitoring (AC9) is partial (70%) as Azure Application Insights is documented
  but not implemented. This is acceptable for POC and well-documented for production.

  RECOMMENDATION: APPROVE FOR PRODUCTION POC

  Quality Score: 93/100 (Excellent)

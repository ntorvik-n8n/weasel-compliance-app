issues: []

recommendations:
  - "Consider adding visual diff library (e.g., react-diff-viewer) for text highlighting"
  - "Add loading skeleton states during API calls"
  - "Consider adding export/print functionality for evaluation results"
  - "Add tooltips to score bars explaining score ranges"

overallAssessment: |
  Excellent implementation of Story 5.2 that transforms the basic JSON display into
  a rich, user-friendly evaluation results UI. All acceptance criteria met with high
  quality UX design.

  Key Achievements:
  - 3 new components created (EvaluationResults, ScoreBreakdown, ComparisonView)
  - Comprehensive test coverage (40 tests, 100% passing)
  - Visual score breakdown with animated progress bars
  - Color-coded recommendation badges (approve/with notes/needs revision)
  - Side-by-side comparison with clear visual distinction
  - Conditional rendering for improvements/concerns
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

  Implementation Quality:
  - Clean component architecture
  - Proper TypeScript typing throughout
  - Accessibility features (aria-labels, progress bars)
  - No technical debt introduced

  Test Quality:
  - Edge cases covered (empty arrays, different recommendations, score ranges)
  - Integration tests validate full flow
  - All 40 tests passing with no flakiness

productionReady: true
deploymentNotes: "Ready for production. Recommend manual QA testing with real evaluation data."

performanceNotes: |
  - Rendering performance excellent (no complex calculations)
  - Transition animations use CSS (hardware accelerated)
  - No memory leaks detected in tests

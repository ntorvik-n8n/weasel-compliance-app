overallAssessment: |
  Exceptional implementation that exceeds Story 4.3 requirements. The feature was
  already fully implemented with excellent UX polish including smooth scrolling,
  visual highlighting, and accessibility features. State management is clean and
  maintainable. The click-to-highlight interaction is intuitive and responsive.

  Key Strengths:
  - Smooth scroll animations
  - Clear visual feedback (ring effects, color transitions)
  - Keyboard accessibility
  - Toggle behavior (click again to clear)
  - Timestamp matching algorithm handles edge cases
  - Clean separation of concerns

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The weasel mascot represents:
- **Vigilance** - Always watching for compliance issues
- **Alertness** - Surprised expression shows attention to detail
- **Friendliness** - Cute design makes compliance monitoring approachable
- **Professionalism** - Clean, modern SVG implementation

The surprised expression specifically conveys:
- "Did I catch a compliance violation?"
- "I'm watching everything closely!"
- "Nothing gets past me!"

# Epic 1: File Upload & Storage Infrastructure

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** EPIC-1
**Epic Name:** File Upload & Storage Infrastructure
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Foundation)
**Status:** Done ✅
**Completed:** 2025-10-11
**Target Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation
**Quality Score:** 92.7/100 (Excellent)

## Epic Goal

Establish a robust, secure file upload system that allows compliance officers to easily upload JSON call log files through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, with intelligent filename collision handling and persistent storage in Azure Blob Storage.

**Key Benefits:**
- Streamlined workflow for compliance officers uploading call logs
- Reduced manual errors through drag-and-drop interface
- Zero data loss through intelligent collision handling
- Reliable persistence through Azure integration

### Storage Architecture
```
Azure Blob Storage Structure:
/call-logs/
  /raw/                           # Original uploaded files
    /2024/10/09/                  # Date-based organization
      chatlog1.json
      chatlog1_001.json           # Collision resolution
  /processed/                     # AI-analyzed files (Epic 3)
    /2024/10/09/
      chatlog1_analysis.json
  /backups/                       # Backup copies before replacement
    /2024/10/09/
      chatlog1_backup_timestamp.json
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements (9/9 Complete ✅)
- ✅ Users can drag-and-drop JSON files onto upload zone
- ✅ Users can browse and select files through traditional file picker
- ✅ System validates JSON structure before upload
- ✅ System detects filename collisions automatically
- ✅ Users can choose collision resolution strategy (timestamp, increment, replace, skip, custom)
- ✅ Files are securely stored in Azure Blob Storage with proper organization
- ✅ Upload progress is displayed in real-time
- ✅ Failed uploads can be retried (automatic + manual)
- ✅ Upload history is maintained for audit purposes

### Performance Requirements (4/4 Complete ✅)
- ✅ File upload completes within 10 seconds for files up to 5MB (Actual: 3-8s)
- ✅ Collision detection occurs within 2 seconds (Actual: <500ms)
- ✅ Support for up to 5 concurrent file uploads
- ✅ Progress updates refresh at least every 500ms

### Security Requirements (5/5 Complete ✅)
- ✅ File size limits enforced (10MB default, configurable)
- ✅ Filename sanitization prevents malicious names
- ✅ Connection strings stored securely in Azure Key Vault (documented)
- ✅ Files encrypted at rest in Azure Blob Storage
- ✅ Files encrypted in transit (HTTPS)

## Filename Collision Resolution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Timestamp Append (Default)
- **Pattern:** `originalname_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- **Example:** `chatlog1.json` → `chatlog1_20251009_143027.json`
- **Advantages:** Preserves chronological order, human-readable

### Strategy 2: Incremental Numbering
- **Pattern:** `originalname_###.json`
- **Example:** `chatlog1.json` → `chatlog1_001.json`
- **Advantages:** Clean naming, sequential organization

### Strategy 3: User Choice
- **Options:** Rename, Replace (with backup), Skip
- **Interface:** Modal dialog with preview of new name
- **Safeguards:** Backup creation before replacement

### Strategy 4: UUID Suffix
- **Pattern:** `originalname_shortUUID.json`
- **Example:** `chatlog1.json` → `chatlog1_a7b2c9.json`
- **Advantages:** Guaranteed uniqueness, compact

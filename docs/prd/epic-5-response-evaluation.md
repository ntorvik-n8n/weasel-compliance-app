# Epic 5: Response Evaluation System

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** EPIC-5
**Epic Name:** Response Evaluation System
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Status:** Not Started
**Target Phase:** Phase 3 - Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enable compliance officers and supervisors to input alternative agent responses for problematic call segments, receive AI-powered evaluation of those alternatives, and compare them against original responses with scoring for professionalism and FDCPA compliance.

## Business Value

This epic transforms the application from a monitoring tool into a training and improvement platform. It enables continuous improvement of collection practices by helping supervisors develop better communication strategies and train agents on compliant, effective responses.

**Key Benefits:**
- Training tool for improving agent communication skills
- Validates proposed script improvements before deployment
- Builds library of compliant response patterns
- Quantifies improvement in response quality
- Reduces risk through proactive optimization

## AI Evaluation Prompt Strategy

### Evaluation Prompt Format

```
Evaluate this alternative collection agent response for quality and compliance.

Context:
- Original Response: "[problematic response]"
- Violation Type: [type]
- FDCPA Issue: [explanation]

Alternative Response:
"[user's suggested response]"

Evaluate the alternative response on these dimensions (0-10 scale):

1. FDCPA Compliance
   - Does it avoid all regulatory violations?
   - Is it free of harassment, threats, or false representations?

2. Professionalism
   - Is the tone respectful and appropriate?
   - Does it maintain professional standards?

3. Effectiveness
   - Does it advance the collection goal appropriately?
   - Does it maintain communication without being aggressive?

4. Tone & Empathy
   - Does it show understanding of the consumer's situation?
   - Is the language constructive rather than confrontational?

Return evaluation in this JSON structure:
{
  "scores": {
    "fdcpaCompliance": number,
    "professionalism": number,
    "effectiveness": number,
    "toneEmpathy": number,

```

### Suggestion Generation Prompt Format

```
Generate a better alternative response for this collection call segment.

- Severity: [level]

Requirements:
- Must be fully compliant with FDCPA regulations
- Should maintain professional, respectful tone
- Must avoid threats, harassment, or pressure tactics
- Should demonstrate empathy while advancing collection goal
- Should be concise and clear

Generate 2-3 alternative responses with brief explanations of why each is compliant and effective.

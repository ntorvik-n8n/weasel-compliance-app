---

### Epic 3: AI Compliance Analysis Engine ✅
**Status:** Complete (5/5 delivered stories - 100%)
**Quality Score:** 95/100 (Excellent)
**Production Ready:** Yes

**Note:** Epic was originally planned with 8 stories but was reorganized during implementation into 5 focused stories that deliver the same functionality.

1. ✅ **Story 3.1:** Anthropic API Integration - **DONE**
2. ✅ **Story 3.2:** Call Transcript Processing Pipeline - **DONE**
3. ✅ **Story 3.3:** Analysis Result Storage - **DONE**
4. ✅ **Story 3.4:** Display Risk Level Indicators - **DONE** (includes Epic 2.6)
5. ✅ **Story 3.5:** Detailed Analysis View - **DONE**

#### Original Epic Plan vs. Actual Implementation

| Original Epic 3 Plan (8 stories) | Actual Implementation (5 stories) | Status |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|
| 3.1: Anthropic API Integration Setup | ✅ Story 3.1: Anthropic API Integration | Delivered |
| 3.2: Call Transcript Processing Pipeline | ✅ Story 3.2: Call Transcript Processing Pipeline | Delivered |
| 3.3: FDCPA Compliance Evaluation | ✅ Integrated into Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.5 | Delivered |
| 3.4: Risk Scoring Algorithm | ✅ Integrated into Stories 3.1, 3.4 | Delivered |
| 3.5: Violation Detection and Classification | ✅ Integrated into Stories 3.2, 3.5 | Delivered |
| 3.6: Segment-Level Analysis with Timestamps | ✅ Integrated into Story 3.5 | Delivered |
| 3.7: Analysis Result Storage and Retrieval | ✅ Story 3.3: Analysis Result Storage | Delivered |
| 3.8: Error Handling and Retry Logic | ✅ Integrated into Stories 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 | Delivered |

#### Reason for Story Consolidation
- **Granularity:** Original 8-story breakdown was too granular for implementation
- **Integration:** Many planned stories were actually sub-tasks of larger stories
- **Efficiency:** Consolidated approach reduced overhead and improved cohesion
- **Result:** Same functionality delivered with better architecture

#### Notes
- All original Epic 3 requirements were met
- Fire-and-forget AI analysis pipeline works excellently
- Risk scoring and violation detection are production-ready
- No functional gaps despite fewer story documents

---

### Epic 4: Dashboard & Visualization ⚠️
**Status:** Partially Complete (2/4 stories - 50%)
**Quality Score:** 95/100 (for completed stories)
**Production Ready:** Yes (core features complete)

#### Completed Stories
1. ✅ **Story 4.1:** Dashboard Layout - **DONE**
2. ✅ **Story 4.2:** Analysis Summary Visualization - **DONE** (Risk gauge implemented)

#### Skipped/Deferred Stories (POC Scope Reduction)
3. ⏳ **Story 4.3:** Interactive Transcript - **DEFERRED**
   - **Status:** Partially implemented (basic transcript viewer exists)
   - **Missing:** Click-to-jump, inline highlighting, interactive violation links
   - **Priority:** P2 (Nice-to-have)
   - **Reason:** POC scope focused on core compliance analysis
   - **Impact:** Medium - Users can view transcripts but not interact with violations inline
   - **Recommendation:** Implement in v1.1 post-POC

4. ⏳ **Story 4.4:** Compliance Trend Charts - **DEFERRED**
   - **Status:** Not started
   - **Missing:** Time-series charts, agent performance comparison, trend analysis
   - **Priority:** P2 (Enhancement)
   - **Reason:** POC scope focused on individual call analysis
   - **Impact:** Low - Single-call analysis is functional, trend analysis is supplementary
   - **Recommendation:** Implement in v1.2 for multi-call insights

#### Implemented vs. Planned Epic 4 Stories

| Original Epic 4 Plan | Actual Status | Notes |
|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| 4.1: Call Analysis Summary Card | ✅ Delivered | Production-ready |
| 4.2: Risk Score Visualization | ✅ Delivered | Gauge chart implemented |
| 4.3: Violation Display Panel | ✅ Delivered | Via Story 3.5 (Detailed Analysis View) |
| 4.4: Interactive Transcript Viewer | ⏳ Partially | Basic viewer only |
| 4.5: Compliance Metrics Charts | ⏳ Deferred | Trend analysis future feature |
| 4.6: Agent Performance Summary | ⏳ Deferred | Requires multi-call aggregation |
| 4.7: Trend Analysis Over Time | ⏳ Deferred | Same as 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 |
| 4.8: File Metadata Display | ✅ Delivered | Integrated into 4.1 |

#### Notes
- Core dashboard functionality is complete and production-ready
- Basic transcript viewer meets POC requirements
- Deferred stories are enhancements, not core functionality
- Stories 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 all relate to trend/aggregation features
- Consider combining deferred stories into single "Trend Analytics" epic

## Recent Enhancements (2025-10-12)

### 1. AI Reliability Improvements (Story 3.1 Enhancement)

**Problem:** Anthropic Claude API occasionally returns malformed JSON, causing analysis failures that required manual re-upload.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive retry and repair logic.

**Features:**
- Automatic retry up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- JSON repair strategies:
  - Removes markdown code blocks (```json)
  - Extracts JSON from surrounding text
  - Fixes trailing commas
  - Fixes missing commas between properties
- Schema validation using TypeScript type guards
- Detailed error logging for debugging

**Impact:**
- Eliminates need for manual re-upload on transient API issues
- Improves user experience with automatic recovery
- Reduces failed analysis rate by ~80-90% (estimated)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/anthropic/client.ts`

### 2. UI/UX Enhancements (Story 4.2 Enhancement)

**Problem:** Second metric box next to "Violations Found" was conditionally displayed, causing inconsistent layout with blank spaces.

**Solution:** Added intelligent "Violation Severity" metric with fallback cascade.

**Features:**
- Primary: Shows highest violation severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with color coding
- Fallback 1: Shows call duration if no violations
- Fallback 2: Shows "None" in green for clean calls
- Color-coded visual hierarchy:
  - Critical = Red
  - High = Orange
  - Medium = Yellow
  - Low = Blue

**Impact:**
- Consistent UI layout - no blank spaces
- Immediate severity assessment at a glance
- Better visual hierarchy for risk awareness

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard/AnalysisSummaryCard.tsx`

### 3. Comprehensive Test Dataset

**Problem:** Limited test data (only 3 sample files) for comprehensive testing.

**Solution:** Generated 23 diverse sample call logs covering full spectrum of compliance scenarios.

**Dataset Composition:**
- **Original files (3):** compliant-call.json, standard-call.json, high-risk-call.json
- **Extended dataset (20):** call-log-001 through call-log-020
  - 8 compliant/low-risk calls (1-2/10) - proper FDCPA disclosures, empathetic service
  - 6 moderate-risk calls (4-6/10) - some pressure/issues but manageable
  - 6 high-risk/critical calls (7-9/10) - major violations, threats, harassment

**Realistic Scenarios:**
- Professional payment negotiations
- Proper rights disclosures and dispute handling
- Harassment and threats
- Workplace/neighbor contact threats
- False legal threats (arrest, garnishment, property seizure)
- Abusive and condescending language
- Improper notice and aggressive deadlines
- Flexible payment arrangements and fee waivers

**Impact:**
- Full risk spectrum testing (0-10 range)
- Validates traffic light color coding (red/orange/yellow/green)
- Realistic demonstration scenarios
- Comprehensive AI analysis accuracy validation
- Portfolio analytics trend testing

**Files Created:**
- `sample-files/call-log-001.json` through `call-log-020.json`
- `sample-files/README.md` (comprehensive documentation with risk assessments)

## Known Limitations (POC Scope)

### By Design (Not Implemented)
1. **Authentication:** Not implemented - planned for production
2. **Rate Limiting:** Not implemented - recommended for production
3. **Trend Charts:** Deferred to v1.2 (Story 4.4)
4. **E2E Tests:** Pending Azure connection validation
5. **CSRF Protection:** Not implemented - required for production

### Technical Constraints
1. **Azure Static Web Apps:** 250MB deployment limit
2. **API Timeout:** Next.js serverless function limits
3. **Concurrent Uploads:** Limited to 5 files (POC scope)
4. **Database:** None - using blob storage only

### Acceptable Trade-offs
- Basic accessibility (80/100) - enhancements recommended
- Limited batch operations - sufficient for POC
- No real-time updates - refresh required for status changes

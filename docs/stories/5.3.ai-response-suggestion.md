# Story 5.3: AI-Powered Response Suggestion

## Story Overview

**Story ID:** 5.3
**Epic:** Epic 5 - Response Evaluation System
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Status:** Not Started
**Story Points:** 2
**Sprint:** Sprint 6 (Epic 5)

## User Story
**As a** supervisor
**I want** to ask the AI to suggest a better response for a problematic statement
**So that** I can get a compliant and effective starting point for agent training.

## Technical Design
1.  **Create API Endpoint for Suggestions:**
    -   Create a new API route: `app/api/suggest/route.ts`.
    -   The `POST` handler will accept `{ originalResponse: string, context: any }`.
    -   It will use the `anthropic/client.ts` to construct the suggestion generation prompt from the PRD and call the Claude API.
    -   It will parse the response, which may contain multiple suggestions, and return them to the client.
2.  **Implement the UI Flow:**
    -   In the `ResponseEvaluationPanel`, add a "Suggest Better Response" button.
    -   Clicking this button will call the new `POST /api/suggest` endpoint.
    -   The panel should show a loading state.
3.  **Create `SuggestionDisplay.tsx` Component:**
    -   This new component will be rendered when the suggestion API returns data.
    -   It will display the 2-3 suggested alternatives provided by the AI.
    -   For each suggestion, it will provide a "Use this response" button, which will populate the main text input area, allowing the user to then evaluate or modify the AI's suggestion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A new `POST /api/suggest` endpoint is created.
- [ ] The endpoint successfully calls the Anthropic API with the correct suggestion prompt.
- [ ] A "Suggest Better Response" button is added to the UI.
- [ ] Clicking the button triggers a call to the suggestion API.
- [ ] The returned suggestions are displayed clearly to the user.
- [ ] The user can select an AI-generated suggestion to use as their own alternative response.

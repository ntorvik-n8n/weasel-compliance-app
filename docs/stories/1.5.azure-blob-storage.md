## Story Overview

**Story ID:** 1.5
**Epic:** Epic 1 - File Upload & Storage Infrastructure
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Status:** Done ✅
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Oct 2025)
**Completed:** 2025-10-10
**QA Approved:** 2025-10-10 (Score: 93/100)

## User Story

**As a** system administrator
**I want** uploaded call log files to be securely stored in Azure Blob Storage with proper organization
**So that** files persist reliably, are accessible for analysis, and can be managed with Azure's enterprise-grade storage capabilities

## Background

Azure Blob Storage provides the persistent, scalable, secure storage layer for all call log files. This story establishes the integration with Azure, implements the storage hierarchy, manages connection security, and ensures reliable file operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Azure Blob Storage Configuration**
   - [ ] Azure Storage Account created and configured
   - [ ] Three blob containers created:
     - `call-logs-raw` (original uploaded files)
     - `call-logs-processed` (analyzed files with results)
     - `call-logs-backups` (backup copies)
   - [ ] Connection string stored securely in Azure Key Vault
   - [ ] Environment variable configuration for local development
   - [ ] Storage client initialized in Next.js API routes

2. **Storage Hierarchy Implementation**
   - [ ] Files organized by date: `/YYYY/MM/DD/filename.json`
   - [ ] Date-based folder structure automatically created on upload
   - [ ] Raw files stored in `call-logs-raw` container
   - [ ] Processed files stored in `call-logs-processed` container
   - [ ] Backup files stored in `call-logs-backups` container

3. **File Upload Operations**
   - [ ] Upload file from Next.js API route to Azure Blob Storage
   - [ ] Set appropriate content-type (application/json)
   - [ ] Store file metadata as blob metadata:
     - Original filename
     - Upload timestamp
     - File size
     - Uploader ID (if auth implemented)
     - Processing status (uploaded, processing, analyzed, error)
   - [ ] Return blob URL and metadata after successful upload

4. **File Retrieval Operations**
   - [ ] Retrieve file by name and date path
   - [ ] List all files in container with pagination
   - [ ] Filter files by date range
   - [ ] Retrieve file metadata without downloading content
   - [ ] Download file content when needed for analysis

5. **File Management Operations**
   - [ ] Check if file exists (for collision detection - Story 1.4)
   - [ ] Copy file to backup location
   - [ ] Delete file (with confirmation requirements)
   - [ ] Update file metadata (processing status, analysis results)
   - [ ] Move file between containers (e.g., raw → processed)

6. **Security Implementation**
   - [ ] Connection strings never exposed in client-side code
   - [ ] Azure Key Vault integration for production secrets
   - [ ] Proper access control on blob containers
   - [ ] Files encrypted at rest (Azure default encryption)
   - [ ] Files encrypted in transit (HTTPS only)
   - [ ] SAS token generation for time-limited access (if needed)

### Non-Functional Requirements

7. **Performance**
   - [ ] File upload completes within 10 seconds for 5MB files
   - [ ] File listing returns within 2 seconds for 1,000 files
   - [ ] Metadata retrieval completes within 500ms
   - [ ] Parallel uploads supported (up to 5 concurrent)

8. **Reliability**
   - [ ] Retry logic for transient Azure service failures
   - [ ] Exponential backoff for rate limiting
   - [ ] Graceful degradation if Azure service unavailable
   - [ ] Transaction logging for audit trail

9. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Azure Application Insights integration for storage operations
   - [ ] Log all upload/download operations
   - [ ] Track storage usage metrics
   - [ ] Alert on storage failures or quota limits

## Technical Design

### Azure Blob Storage Client Setup

```typescript
// lib/azure/blobStorageClient.ts

import { BlobServiceClient, ContainerClient } from '@azure/storage-blob';

interface BlobStorageConfig {
  connectionString: string;
  containers: {
    raw: string;
    processed: string;
    backups: string;
  };
}

export class BlobStorageService {
  private serviceClient: BlobServiceClient;
  private containers: {
    raw: ContainerClient;
    processed: ContainerClient;
    backups: ContainerClient;
  };

  constructor(config: BlobStorageConfig) {
    this.serviceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(
      config.connectionString
    );
    this.containers = {
      raw: this.serviceClient.getContainerClient(config.containers.raw),
      processed: this.serviceClient.getContainerClient(config.containers.processed),
      backups: this.serviceClient.getContainerClient(config.containers.backups),
    };
  }

  // Initialize containers if they don't exist
  async initializeContainers(): Promise<void> {
    // Create containers with appropriate access levels
  }

  // Upload file with date-based path
  async uploadFile(
    file: Buffer,
    filename: string,
    metadata: FileMetadata,
    containerType: 'raw' | 'processed' | 'backups' = 'raw'
  ): Promise<UploadResult> {
    // Generate date-based path: /2025/10/10/filename.json
    // Upload file with metadata
    // Return blob URL and metadata
  }

  // Check if file exists
  async fileExists(
    filename: string,
    date: Date,
    containerType: 'raw' | 'processed' | 'backups' = 'raw'
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check existence for collision detection
  }

  // Get file metadata
  async getFileMetadata(
    filename: string,
    date: Date,
    containerType: 'raw' | 'processed' | 'backups' = 'raw'
  ): Promise<FileMetadata | null> {
    // Retrieve metadata without downloading file
  }

  // Download file content
  async downloadFile(
    filename: string,
    date: Date,
    containerType: 'raw' | 'processed' | 'backups' = 'raw'
  ): Promise<Buffer> {
    // Download file for processing
  }

  // List files with pagination
  async listFiles(
    options: ListOptions
  ): Promise<PaginatedFileList> {
    // List files with filtering and pagination
  }

  // Copy file to backup
  async backupFile(
    filename: string,
    sourceDate: Date
  ): Promise<string> {
    // Copy from raw to backups with timestamp
  }

  // Update file metadata
  async updateMetadata(
    filename: string,
    date: Date,
    metadata: Partial<FileMetadata>,
    containerType: 'raw' | 'processed' | 'backups' = 'raw'
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Update blob metadata
  }
}
```

### API Route for File Upload

```typescript
// app/api/upload/route.ts

import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getBlobStorageService } from '@/lib/azure/blobStorageClient';
import { validateCallLogJSON } from '@/lib/validators';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // 1. Parse multipart form data
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const file = formData.get('file') as File;

    if (!file) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'No file provided' },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // 2. Read file content
    const buffer = Buffer.from(await file.arrayBuffer());

    // 3. Validate JSON structure (Story 1.8)
    const validation = validateCallLogJSON(buffer.toString());
    if (!validation.isValid) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Invalid JSON structure', details: validation.errors },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // 4. Check for collision (Story 1.4)
    const blobService = getBlobStorageService();
    const exists = await blobService.fileExists(file.name, new Date());

    if (exists) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { collision: true, filename: file.name },
        { status: 409 }
      );
    }

    // 5. Upload to Azure Blob Storage
    const result = await blobService.uploadFile(buffer, file.name, {
      originalFilename: file.name,
      uploadedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      size: file.size,
      status: 'uploaded',
      contentType: 'application/json',
    });

    // 6. Return success response
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      filename: result.filename,
      url: result.url,
      uploadedAt: result.uploadedAt,
    });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Upload error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Upload failed', message: error.message },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

- ✅ Stored in `.env.local` for development
- ✅ `.env.local` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Azure Key Vault documented for production
- ✅ Connection string validation on startup

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Containers set to private (no anonymous access)
- ✅ HTTPS enforced (secure transfer required)
- ✅ Encryption at rest (Azure default)
- ✅ Encryption in transit (HTTPS)

**Production Recommendations:**
- Use Azure Managed Identity (no connection strings)
- Enable Soft Delete (7-30 day retention)
- Enable Versioning (recovery from overwrites)
- Implement Lifecycle Policies (cost optimization)
- Set up Azure Monitor alerts

### Performance Metrics

**Expected Performance:**
- File upload (5MB): <10 seconds
- File listing (1000 files): <2 seconds
- Metadata retrieval: <500ms
- Collision check: <500ms
- Retry overhead: +1-10 seconds (transient failures only)

**Retry Timing:**
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: ~1 second delay (with jitter)
- Attempt 3: ~2 seconds delay (with jitter)
- Attempt 4: ~4 seconds delay (with jitter)
- Max delay: 10 seconds (capped)

### Cost Estimates

**POC Monthly Costs (LRS, Standard):**
- Storage (5GB): $0.10
- Write transactions (5,000): $0.02
- Read transactions (10,000): $0.004
- **Total: ~$0.12/month**

**Note:** Actual costs may vary based on usage patterns and Azure pricing updates.

- ✅ ESLint: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** (Score: 95/100)

**Validated:**
- ✅ Connection strings server-side only (never in client code)
- ✅ Environment variable security (.env.local in .gitignore)
- ✅ Azure Key Vault integration documented for production
- ✅ Private container access (no anonymous access)
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement (Azure default)
- ✅ Encryption at rest (Azure default)
- ✅ Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs

**Production Recommendations:**
- Add authentication to /api/admin/init-storage endpoint
- Use Azure Key Vault for connection string storage
- Consider Azure Managed Identity (eliminates connection strings)
- Enable Soft Delete for recovery (7-30 days)
- Enable Versioning for accidental overwrites
- Implement Lifecycle Policies for cost optimization
- Set up Azure Monitor alerts

### Performance Assessment

✅ **PASS** (Score: 95/100)

**Expected Performance:**
| Operation | Target | Expected | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Collision check | <2s | <500ms | ✅ PASS |
| Metadata retrieval | <500ms | <200ms | ✅ PASS |
| File listing (1000 files) | <2s | 1-2s | ✅ PASS |
| File upload (5MB) | <10s | 3-8s | ✅ PASS |
| Retry overhead | Acceptable | +1-10s | ✅ PASS |

**Optimizations:**
- Single Azure SDK call for uploads (minimized round trips)
- Pagination limits prevent large data transfers
- Metadata retrieval without download
- Retry only on transient errors (fast-fail on non-retryable)
- Jitter prevents thundering herd on retries
- Max delay cap (10s) prevents excessive waits

**Note:** Actual performance metrics require Azure connection for validation.

### Architecture Review

**Storage Hierarchy:**
```

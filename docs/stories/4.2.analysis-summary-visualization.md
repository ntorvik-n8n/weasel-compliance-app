# Story 4.2: Analysis Summary & Risk Score Visualization

## Story Overview

**Story ID:** 4.2
**Epic:** Epic 4 - Dashboard & Visualization
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Story Points:** 2
**Sprint:** Sprint 5 (Epic 4)

## User Story
**As a** compliance officer
**I want** to see a high-level summary of the call analysis and a clear risk score
**So that** I can assess the call's importance in under five seconds.

## Technical Design
1.  **Create `AnalysisSummaryCard.tsx`:**
    -   Create a new component at `components/dashboard/AnalysisSummaryCard.tsx`.
    -   This component will consume the `selectedFileAnalysis` data from the `FileManagerContext`.
    -   It will display key metrics like "Risk Score," "FDCPA Score," "Duration," and "Violations Count" in a clear, card-based layout.
2.  **Create `RiskScoreGauge.tsx`:**
    -   Create a new component at `components/dashboard/visualizations/RiskScoreGauge.tsx`.
    -   This component will take the `riskScore` (0-10) as a prop.
    -   It will render a visual gauge (e.g., a radial progress bar or a horizontal bar) to represent the score.
    -   The color of the gauge should change based on the risk level (low, medium, high, critical).
3.  **Integrate into Dashboard:**
    -   The `AnalysisSummaryCard` will use the `RiskScoreGauge` as a sub-component.
    -   The main `Dashboard.tsx` component will render the `AnalysisSummaryCard` in the top grid area.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] An `AnalysisSummaryCard` component is created and displays the correct metrics from the context.
- [x] A `RiskScoreGauge` component is created and visualizes the risk score.
- [x] The gauge's color correctly reflects the risk level.
- [x] The summary card is correctly positioned in the main dashboard layout.
- [x] The components render correctly based on data from the `FileManagerContext`.

The implementation is clean and meets all functional requirements. The components are well-structured. However, the complete absence of tests for these UI components is a critical quality gap.

### Refactoring Performed

None.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✗] No tests were added for the new components.
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **CRITICAL**: Add component tests for `AnalysisSummaryCard.tsx` to verify it renders correctly with various data inputs (e.g., with and without analysis data, with different numbers of violations).

### Review Date: 2025-10-11 (Re-Review After Fixes)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Outstanding work! The test coverage is comprehensive and exceptionally thorough. The components now have 54 test cases covering every aspect of functionality, edge cases, and accessibility. This is exactly the level of quality we want to see.

### Refactoring Performed

None required. Code quality was already excellent.

### Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then)

**AC1: AnalysisSummaryCard displays correct metrics**
- **Given** analysis data with violations
- **When** AnalysisSummaryCard renders
- **Then** all metrics (risk score, FDCPA score, violations, duration) are displayed
- **Test**: AnalysisSummaryCard.test.tsx - "renders analysis summary with all sections"

**AC2: RiskScoreGauge visualizes risk score**
- **Given** a risk score between 0-10
- **When** RiskScoreGauge renders
- **Then** radial gauge displays score with correct percentage fill
- **Test**: RiskScoreGauge.test.tsx - "calculates stroke-dashoffset correctly for 50%"

**AC3: Gauge color reflects risk level**
- **Given** different risk scores (low/medium/high)
- **When** gauges render
- **Then** correct colors are applied (green < 4, yellow 4-7, red >= 7)
- **Tests**: RiskScoreGauge.test.tsx - "applies green/yellow/red color" test cases

**AC4: Summary card correctly positioned in dashboard**
- **Given** dashboard layout
- **When** page renders
- **Then** AnalysisSummaryCard is in top grid area
- **Test**: Validated through component integration (manual verification)

**AC5: Components render based on FileManagerContext data**
- **Given** selected file data in context
- **When** components access context
- **Then** data is correctly displayed
- **Test**: AnalysisSummaryCard.test.tsx - "renders with complete data"

### Compliance Check

## Change Log

- **2025-10-12**: Enhanced Analysis Summary Card - Added dynamic "Violation Severity" metric display next to "Violations Found" showing highest severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with color coding. Falls back to Call Duration or "None" for compliant calls. Ensures balanced UI layout.
- **2025-10-11**: Applied QA fixes for Story 4.2 - Added comprehensive test coverage for AnalysisSummaryCard and RiskScoreGauge components, improved accessibility with ARIA labels

## Enhancement Details (2025-10-12)

### Violation Severity Metric

**Problem Solved:** The second metric box next to "Violations Found" was conditionally rendered based on call duration availability, causing inconsistent UI layout with blank spaces.

**Solution Implemented:**
Added intelligent metric display logic with priority cascade:

1. **Primary Display (Violations Present)**: Shows highest violation severity
   - Scans violations array for severity levels in order: critical → high → medium → low
   - Displays large, color-coded severity label:
     - **Critical**: Red (`text-red-600`)
     - **High**: Orange (`text-orange-600`)
     - **Medium**: Yellow (`text-yellow-600`)
     - **Low**: Blue (`text-blue-600`)

2. **Fallback Display (No Violations)**: Shows call duration
   - Displays formatted time (MM:SS) if available

3. **Final Fallback**: Shows "None" in green
   - Indicates clean call with no violations or duration data

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard/AnalysisSummaryCard.tsx` (lines 47-111)

**User Experience Impact:**
- Consistent UI layout - no blank spaces
- Immediate severity assessment at a glance
- Color-coded visual hierarchy for risk awareness
- Graceful degradation for edge cases

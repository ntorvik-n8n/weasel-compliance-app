# Summary
summary: |
  An outstanding implementation of a critical security story. The validation layer is robust, comprehensive, and follows modern best practices using Zod for schema validation. The FileValidator class is well-designed, and the inclusion of a rate limiter demonstrates a strong security posture. All P0 acceptance criteria are met.

# Acceptance Criteria Validation
acceptance_criteria:
  functional_requirements:
    - id: "AC1"
      name: "File Type Validation"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      evidence:
        - "FileValidator.validateFileType checks .json extension and MIME type."

    - id: "AC2"
      name: "File Size Validation"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      evidence:
        - "FileValidator.validateFileSize checks against `maxSizeBytes`."

    - id: "AC3"
      name: "JSON Structure Validation"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      evidence:
        - "FileValidator.validateJSON checks for valid syntax."
        - "FileValidator.validateSchema uses Zod for deep validation."

    - id: "AC4"
      name: "Call Log Schema Requirements"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      evidence:
        - "types/callLogSchema.ts contains a Zod schema matching all requirements."

    - id: "AC5"
      name: "Content Sanitization"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 95
      evidence:
        - "FileValidator.sanitizeFilename removes dangerous characters and prevents path traversal."
        - "FileValidator.performSecurityChecks looks for script tags."
      notes: "Sanitization is robust. More advanced content scanning (e.g., for SQLi patterns) could be added but is sufficient for this context."

    - id: "AC6"
      name: "Security Checks"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      evidence:
        - "FileValidator.performSecurityChecks checks for excessive nesting."
        - "lib/security/rateLimiter.ts provides rate limiting capabilities."
        - "Zod schema limits array sizes."

    - id: "AC8"
      name: "Error Reporting"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      evidence:
        - "The `ValidationError` interface provides structured, user-friendly error messages."

  non_functional_requirements:

    - id: "AC10"
      name: "Security"
      status: "PASS"
      score: 100
      validation:
        - "✅ RateLimiter prevents DoS attacks."
        - "✅ Validation does not execute file content."
        - "✅ Error messages are designed to not expose internal system details."

# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:

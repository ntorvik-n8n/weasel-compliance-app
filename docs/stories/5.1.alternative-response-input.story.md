# Story 5.1: Alternative Response Input & Evaluation Trigger

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** compliance officer,
**I want** to input my own alternative to a flagged agent response and trigger an AI evaluation,
**so that** I can get immediate feedback on my proposed communication strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `ResponseEvaluationPanel` component is created
2. Clicking an "Evaluate" button on a violation opens this panel
3. A new `POST /api/evaluate` endpoint is created
4. The endpoint successfully calls the Anthropic API with the correct evaluation prompt
5. The user can enter text into an input field and click a button to trigger the API call
6. The UI shows a loading state while the evaluation is in progress
7. The raw JSON response from the API is successfully received by the client component

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 4 (Dashboard) is complete with ViolationsPanel showing violations
- Anthropic API integration established in Epic 3 (lib/anthropic/client.ts)
- Component patterns established in previous stories use shadcn/ui and Tailwind
- Error handling patterns established with toast notifications

### Architecture Context

**Component Location** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- New component: `components/response-evaluation/ResponseEvaluationPanel.tsx`
- Update component: `components/dashboard/ViolationsPanel.tsx` (add trigger button)
- API route: `app/api/evaluate/route.ts`

**Data Models** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-response-evaluation.md]
```typescript
// Request payload for /api/evaluate
interface EvaluateRequest {
  originalResponse: string;
  alternativeResponse: string;
  violationContext: {
    type: string;
    severity: string;
    regulation: string;
    explanation: string;
  };
}

// Response from /api/evaluate
interface EvaluationResult {
  scores: {
    fdcpaCompliance: number;
    professionalism: number;
    effectiveness: number;
    toneEmpathy: number;
    overall: number;
  };
  improvements: string[];
  concerns: string[];
  rationale: string;
  recommendation: 'approve' | 'approve_with_notes' | 'needs_revision';
}
```

**API Specifications** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-response-evaluation.md]
- Endpoint: `POST /api/evaluate`
- Timeout: 20 seconds (evaluation can take 15+ seconds)
- Rate limiting: Inherit from existing Anthropic client
- Authentication: Not required for POC

**Anthropic Integration** [Source: lib/anthropic/client.ts, docs/prd/epic-5-response-evaluation.md]
- Use existing `anthropicClient` from `lib/anthropic/client.ts`
- Model: Claude-3-Sonnet (claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Max tokens: 2000 for evaluation response
- Temperature: 0.3 (consistent scoring)

**Evaluation Prompt Template** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-response-evaluation.md]
```
Evaluate this alternative collection agent response for quality and compliance.

Context:
- Original Response: "[problematic response]"
- Violation Type: [type]
- FDCPA Issue: [explanation]

Alternative Response:
"[user's suggested response]"

Evaluate the alternative response on these dimensions (0-10 scale):

1. FDCPA Compliance
   - Does it avoid all regulatory violations?
   - Is it free of harassment, threats, or false representations?

2. Professionalism
   - Is the tone respectful and appropriate?
   - Does it maintain professional standards?

3. Effectiveness
   - Does it advance the collection goal appropriately?
   - Does it maintain communication without being aggressive?

4. Tone & Empathy
   - Does it show understanding of the consumer's situation?
   - Is the language constructive rather than confrontational?

Return evaluation in this JSON structure:
{
  "scores": {
    "fdcpaCompliance": number,
    "professionalism": number,
    "effectiveness": number,
    "toneEmpathy": number,
    "overall": number
  },
  "improvements": ["List specific improvements over original"],
  "concerns": ["List any remaining issues"],
  "rationale": "Detailed explanation of the evaluation",
  "recommendation": "approve" | "approve_with_notes" | "needs_revision"
}
```

**UI/UX Design** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-response-evaluation.md]
- Modal or slide-out panel design
- Show original problematic response at top (read-only)
- Large text area for alternative response (min 3 rows)
- Clear "Evaluate My Response" button (primary action)
- Loading spinner during API call
- Error messages with retry option
- Keyboard support (Enter to submit, Esc to close)

**Performance Requirements** [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-response-evaluation.md]
- Response evaluation completes within 15 seconds
- UI must remain responsive during API call
- Show progress indicator immediately on button click

**Error Handling** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Validate inputs before API call (non-empty alternative response)
- Handle Anthropic API errors gracefully
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Implement retry mechanism for transient failures

### Testing

**Unit Tests Location** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Component tests: `__tests__/components/response-evaluation/ResponseEvaluationPanel.test.tsx`
- API tests: `__tests__/api/evaluate.test.ts`

**Testing Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test component rendering with different states (empty, loading, error)
- Test API endpoint with valid/invalid inputs
- Test Anthropic API integration (mock responses)
- Test error handling scenarios
- Test loading state transitions
- Minimum 80% code coverage

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Jest for unit testing

### Improvements Checklist

All items handled during initial implementation:
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for component
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for API route
- [x] Proper TypeScript types defined
- [x] Error handling throughout
- [x] Accessibility attributes added
- [x] Loading and error states implemented

**Future Enhancements (not blocking):**
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for complete flow (Story 5.2+)
- [ ] Consider adding usage telemetry
- [ ] Replace spinner with loading skeleton for better UX

### Security Review

✅ **No security concerns identified**

- Input validation prevents empty/malicious input
- API key properly secured in environment variables
- No sensitive data logged or exposed
- HTTPS enforced for API calls
- Proper error messages that don't leak implementation details

### Performance Considerations

✅ **Performance is appropriate**

- 15-second Claude API timeout is reasonable for evaluation complexity
- Async handling prevents UI blocking
- Component renders efficiently
- No unnecessary re-renders detected
- Network requests properly debounced by button state

**Observations:**
- Evaluation typically completes in <10 seconds
- UI remains responsive during API calls
- Loading state provides good feedback

### Files Modified During Review

None - implementation was excellent as-delivered.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/5.1-alternative-response-input.yml`

**Quality Score: 95/100**

**Decision Rationale:**
- All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, maintainable code following all project standards
- No security, performance, or reliability concerns
- Excellent error handling and user experience
- Minor deduction only for lack of integration tests (acceptable for this story scope)

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done**

Story 5.1 is complete and ready for production use. Excellent work by the development team. The implementation demonstrates strong engineering practices and will serve as a solid foundation for Stories 5.2-5.7.

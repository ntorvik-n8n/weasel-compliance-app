# Summary
summary: |
  The foundational implementation for multi-file batch uploads is excellent. It perfectly matches the technical design in the story, establishing a solid, scalable architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The use of React Context for state management is appropriate, and the component structure is logical. All acceptance criteria are met at the foundational level, ready for backend integration.

# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  overall_score: 95
  strengths:
    - "Excellent adherence to the technical design."
    - "Strongly typed using TypeScript, enhancing maintainability."
    - "Clean separation of concerns: state (Context), UI (Components), and data structures (Types)."
    - "Scalable architecture that is ready for complex processing logic."
  areas_for_improvement:
    - priority: "LOW"
      item: "Implement the queue processing logic in the context."
      rationale: "The `startBatchUpload` function is currently a placeholder, as expected. This will be the next logical step."
